# Genre Selection Feature Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented a genre selection feature on the checkout page that saves the user's preferred music genre to their profile in Supabase.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Addition
- **File**: `supabase/migrations/add_music_genre_field.sql`
- **Purpose**: Safely adds `music_genre` VARCHAR(100) column to `user_profiles` table
- **Safety Features**: 
  - Uses `IF NOT EXISTS` check to prevent duplicate columns
  - Includes performance index creation
  - Follows the critical rule for live production sites with customer data

### 2. UI Implementation
- **File**: `src/pages/checkout.tsx`
- **Location**: Added between Billing Information and Terms Agreement sections
- **Features**:
  - Clean dropdown with 15 genre options (Rock, Pop, Hip-Hop/Rap, Electronic/Dance, Jazz, Blues, Country, Folk, Classical, Reggae, R&B/Soul, Metal, Latin, World, Gospel/Religious)
  - Styled to match existing website design
  - Includes proper z-index management and hydration handling
  - Added `musicGenre` field to `billingData` state

### 3. Backend Integration
- **File**: `src/pages/api/sync-user-profile.ts`
- **Added**: `music_genre` field to the interface and processing logic
- **Robust Error Handling**: 
  - Gracefully handles cases where the database column doesn't exist yet
  - Retries without genre field if column is missing
  - Provides clear migration warnings

### 4. Data Flow
- User selects genre from dropdown on checkout page
- Genre value is stored in `billingData.musicGenre` state
- During account creation or profile sync, genre is sent to `/api/sync-user-profile`
- API attempts to save genre to `user_profiles.music_genre` column
- If column doesn't exist, API gracefully continues without it and provides migration warning

## Manual Database Migration Required

**IMPORTANT**: Run this SQL in your Supabase SQL editor to add the database column:

```sql
DO $$ 
BEGIN
    IF NOT EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM information_schema.columns 
        WHERE table_name = 'user_profiles' 
        AND column_name = 'music_genre'
    ) THEN
        ALTER TABLE user_profiles ADD COLUMN music_genre VARCHAR(100);
        CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_user_profiles_music_genre ON user_profiles(music_genre);
        RAISE NOTICE 'Added music_genre column to user_profiles table';
    ELSE
        RAISE NOTICE 'music_genre column already exists in user_profiles table';
    END IF;
END $$;
```

## Files Modified
1. `src/pages/checkout.tsx` - Added genre selection UI and state management
2. `src/pages/api/sync-user-profile.ts` - Added genre field processing and error handling
3. `supabase/migrations/add_music_genre_field.sql` - Database migration script

## Testing
- The feature is ready to test on the live site
- Genre selections will be captured in the checkout flow
- Once the database migration is run, genres will be saved to user profiles
- Until the migration is run, the system gracefully handles the missing column

## Next Steps
1. Run the database migration in Supabase
2. Test the checkout flow with genre selection
3. Verify genre data is being saved to user profiles
4. Add genre display functionality to the admin dashboard (as mentioned by user)

## Safety Features Implemented
- ✅ Safe column addition pattern that preserves existing customer data
- ✅ Graceful error handling for missing database column
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing checkout flow
- ✅ Proper z-index management for UI elements
- ✅ Hydration-safe rendering patterns
