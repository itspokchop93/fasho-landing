Alright perfect! Now i need you to add a Zapier integration into our website. 

Inside the admin dashboard I need you to create a "Settings" tab which we will add many things into as we build upon the admin page. But for now, you can have a "Zapier" section inside this new settings tab. In the Zapier setttings for now lets have a "WebHook URL" input field which i can edit and save my zapier webhook url into or update it in the future if I need to. 


Here is the webhook URL for you to preinstall for me:

@https://hooks.zapier.com/hooks/catch/23839455/u2wp0la/ 

Here is all the things I need sent to the webhook URL:

1. Upon successful checkout, please send the following information to the webhook:

- First & Last Name 
- Email Address
- Billing Address
- Name of packages ordered (each package ordered as its own item)
- Order Date 


2. If a user signs up via the /signup page send the signup information to the web hook:
- First & Last Name 
- Email Address

3. When a user completes the Intake Form on the Thank You page, send the form information AND the customers order information and account information together to the web hook:
- First & Last Name 
- Email Address
- Billing Address
- Name of packages ordered 
- Order Date
- Question 
- Answer

Remember, these should automatically send to the webhook when any of these actions are performed on the website.
